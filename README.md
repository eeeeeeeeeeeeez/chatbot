## Model Provider

This project is configured to use the Google Gemini API directly through the AI SDK Google provider. The active chat and title model is configured in `lib/ai/models.ts` as `gemini-3.5-flash`, which is available in the Gemini API model list.

Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in your environment. The provider also supports `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` as a fallback variable name.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of Chatbot to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/chatbot)

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Chatbot. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various AI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Create a Gemini API key in [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Add it to `.env.local` as `GEMINI_API_KEY=...`
3. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm db:migrate # Setup database or apply latest database changes
pnpm dev
```

Your app template should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
